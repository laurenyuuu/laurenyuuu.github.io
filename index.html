              I am a dedicated person who likes to take iniative when faced with new opportunities. My values of compassion, constant growth, and determination drive every action I take. This has led me to pursue leadership positions in the Guerrilla Marketing Society and Chinese Student Association.

              <h6>SAMSUNG</h6>
              <p>
                During my time as a College Product Ambassador I gained insight into product marketing within the field of technology. The deliverables were tailored to capture the attention and interest of my fellow peers as Samsung's focus with the program was the exposure within the college demographic. By preparing for the role through market research, I was able to produce high quality content that aligned with the demographic's current interests and trends.

              <h6>KITAKATA RAMEN</h6>
              <p>
                My experience as a server and eventually kitchen staff taught 
                me about customer service and teamwork. The customer interactions 
                helped me develop soft skills that I plan to carry throughout the 
                rest of my career. It also taught me to value a diverse workplace
                 and taught me how to work effectively to deliver an exceptional
                  experience for our guests. The fast-paced nature of the resturant
                   also helped hone my time management and organization skills as I 
                   often had to work under pressure efficiently.

              <h6>QUESTROM HONORS PROGRAM</h6>
              <p>
                Through the Questrom Honors Program, I was able to gain insight 
                into different fields of business, specifically innovation and research, 
                that taught me how to be a changemaker in the modern era. I am able to 
                make connections with fellow drivern peers that extend beyond the classroom and
                 friendships with professors who are conducting research that makes a positive 
                 impact on the world.

              <h6>GUERILLA MARKETING SOCIETY</h6>
              <p>
                As Secretary of Guerrilla Marketing Society, I am able to
                 understand the logistics behind the events and workshops 
                 the club facilitates. My previous roles as Account Manager
                 of Fuel America and Saxbys taught me how to work with real 
                 clients to develop a marketing strategy that aligns with their
                 current budget and goals. We are also to provide market research
                 within the demographics that companies are interested which is a
                 benefit that many clients enjoy.
